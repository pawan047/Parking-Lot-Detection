# Parking-Lot-Detection
Here I implemented an machine learning algorithm to detect empty lot in parking area which monitors the actual occupancy of a parking lot, provides thr facility with valuable information and navigates drivers all the way to find an empty parking spot
## library used
### cv2
* this is here for computer vision and image processing
* it is used here in Image loading and display,Capturing video, Blurring images, Image resizing, Cartooning images and Identifying objects 
### pickle
* This is used here for implementation of binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object and Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and unpickling is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream  is converted back into an object hierarchy
### cvzone
* it is used here to image and video processing is OpenCV or cv2 
### NumPy
* here it is used for live calculation of parking lot
